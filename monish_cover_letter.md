Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the **Software Engineer** position at **Capgemini**. As a passionate Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience in building scalable AI-powered applications and leading cross-functional teams, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Capgemini's innovative projects and technical excellence.

In my current role as Software Engineer at Bapon IT Services, I have developed and maintained multiple AI-powered platforms including SkillfulSense, HRSuite, and Hyr-Sense, building over 130+ RESTful API endpoints that serve thousands of users. My experience spans the full development lifecycle‚Äîfrom architecting microservices on AWS Lambda and ECS Fargate to integrating complex third-party systems like Agora SDK for real-time communication and multiple payment gateways (Razorpay, Stripe).

During my tenure at Jetzerp Private Limited, I successfully led a cross-functional team of 6 members and spearheaded the migration of Odoo 14 to Odoo 17 Community edition by developing custom migration scripts when no official solution existed. This project required deep problem-solving skills and resulted in an 80% reduction in manual processing time through automated data import systems with Zoho Books API integration.

Additionally, I developed an intelligent invoice processing system for TI Murugappa Group that reduced manual data entry time by 90% using OCR and machine learning pipelines. These experiences have strengthened my ability to tackle complex technical challenges while delivering measurable business value.

My technical expertise spans Python (FastAPI), cloud technologies (AWS Lambda, EC2, S3, Cognito), and modern development practices including microservices architecture and CI/CD pipelines. I'm also AWS Cloud Practitioner certified with a 96.2% score, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and staying current with cloud technologies.

Beyond technical skills, my experience transitioning from mechanical engineering to software development has taught me to approach problems from unique perspectives and adapt quickly to new technologies. I thrive in collaborative environments and have successfully mentored junior developers while maintaining high code quality standards.


I am genuinely excited about the possibility of joining Capgemini and contributing to company mission. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building scalable AI applications, leading technical teams, and optimizing system performance can help drive Capgemini's continued success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you and am available for an interview at your convenience.

**Sincerely,**  
**Monishwaran .C**
