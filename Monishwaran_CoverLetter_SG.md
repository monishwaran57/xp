Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at your company. With 2 years of hands-on experience in backend development, cloud-native systems, and ERP integrations, I bring a strong foundation in Python, FastAPI, and AWS, coupled with proven problem-solving skills and cross-functional teamwork.  

At Bapon IT Services, I developed and maintained AI-powered applications, building 130+ RESTful APIs, deploying microservices on AWS, and integrating secure payment and authentication systems. Previously, at Jetzerp, I led a team delivering ERP solutions, successfully migrating systems and creating real-time inventory and reporting platforms. These experiences have equipped me with the ability to design scalable, cost-optimized systems and collaborate effectively with diverse stakeholders.  

I am particularly drawn to Singapore‚Äôs position as a global technology hub and its emphasis on innovation. I am confident my technical expertise, coupled with my eagerness to contribute to impactful projects, will enable me to add value to your team.  

I would be delighted to further discuss how my skills align with your company‚Äôs goals. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
**Monishwaran C**
